## Implementing real-time/technical applications using File handling.
## Lab VI
    1. Write a program that reads text from a file and writes it into another file but in the reverse order.
    2. Write a program that reads a file and prints only those lines that has the word print
    3. Write a program to read a file that contains small case characters. Then write these characters into another file with all lowercase characters converted into uppercase.
    4. Write a program that reads a file and copies its contents in another file. While copying replace all full stops with commas.
    5. Write a program that exchanges the contents of two files.
    6. Write a program that writes data to a file in such a way that each character after a full stop is capitalized and all the numbers are written in brackets.
    7. Write a menu driven program that reads details of a faculty. Provide options to add a new record, delete a record, update an existing record and display all or a particular record.
    8. Write a menu driven program that maintains a file directory that stores the name and telephone number of a person. The program must allow users to add new contacts, search a contact based on name, update the number, update the name and delete a contact.


## Practical - Implementing real-time/technical applications using Exception handling. 
    1. Write a program to find the smaller of two given numbers. If the first number is smaller than the second, then generate an assertion error.
    2. Write a program to find the square root of a number. Throw an exception if a negative number is entered.
